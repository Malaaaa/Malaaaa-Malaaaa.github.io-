The callback hell problem was very prominent in JavaScript before, and was the most trolled point of JavaScript, but with the release of the ECMAScript6 and ECMAScript7 standards, this problem has been very well solved, and the two magic tools to solve the callback hell are the introduction of ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Promise")," in ECMAScript6, and the introduction of ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Promise")," in ECMAScript7. and the introduction of ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"async/await")," in ECMAScript7. In Dart, the two are almost completely panned in JavaScript: ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Future")," is equivalent to ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Promise"),", and ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"async/await")," doesn't even change its name.
